       It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world,
        cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions.
        When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.

        The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.</p>
